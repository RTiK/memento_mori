# Memento Mori Geeklet

This is a slightly depressing geeklet but at the same a very motivating one. If you are only motivated by deadlines then this Geeklet is aimed at reminding you of the ultimate deadline for all of your side projects, TODOs, etc.

This script draws a character for every day you have lived. A line of these characters is a year of your life. It doesn't stop at the present day. Given the average life expectancy for your country and your gender (you can get them from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy)), the script calculates how much time you got left and draws out your projected life.
